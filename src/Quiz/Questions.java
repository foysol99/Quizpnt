    1)What is compile time and run time?
      Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development.
2) What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
3) How java manage it's memory?
Java allocation including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime environment.
4) What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuider are mutable classes. StringBuffer is thread
safeand synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not, thats why StringBuilder is more faster than StringBuffer.
5) What is Singleton class?
In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
 6) What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization and Deserialization in Java with Example. Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
7) Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
memory for primitive fields, according to their size (int n->32 bits)
memory for reference fields (4 bytes each) (Integer n ->32 bits)
8) Why is String Immutable in Java?
The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. Another reason of why String class is immutable could die due to HashMap.
9) What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
10)The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
the serial and parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC. a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation.
11)What is JIT stands for?
Just in time (JIT)
12) Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
 objects are created inside heap memory and Garbage Collection is a process which removes dead objects from Java Heap space and returns memory back to Heap in Java.
13)Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Being an automatic process, programmers need not initiate the garbage collection process explicitly in the code.
14) What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local
 variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
